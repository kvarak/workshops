# Team responsibilities

This is a series of workshops that should be taken with breaks (could be days or weeks) so that the team can work on their homeworks.

## The parts and goals

The goal is to get some focus to the team. This is done by looking at the team from different views externally and internally. At the end of the series, the following should be identified.

- Stakeholders
  - External requirements
  - Sustainability
- Goals
  - Personal
  - Team
- Team
  - How do we behave
  - Load stars
  - Principles
- Company
  - Rules (adapt or confront)

The above will be the base that the team then will use to setup some Objectives and Key Results.

## Session 1 - Outside forces

**Goal:** Figure out who the stakeholders are and what requirements/orders/expectations that the team feels are put upon them.

When doing this exercise it may happen that some felt requirements are not really requirements, but part of something else (for instance a principle), then park it there and come back to it later on.

**Homework:** For each of the requirements/orders/expectations that have been brought up, figure out if the team can make sure if that in fact is a requirement. If it is, make sure to specify the following for each of them:

- Time frame (when should it be done/complete)
- Measurement (how you measure it; to be able to keep track)
- Common View (specify it in writing for both the team and the stakeholder)

It's also important to deep dive into some of them. Are some actually a solutions to a problem? In that case, dig deeper so that you understand the problem the solution is solving and add the following to the requirement:

- The problem this solution solves.

How to figure it out is up to the team, but the recommended way is to work with the ones that comes from the stakeholder closest to the team and work their way away.

## Session 2 - Inside forces

**Goal:** Figure out what the internal goals are. Try to formulate them in a good manner.

## Session 3 - Goals
